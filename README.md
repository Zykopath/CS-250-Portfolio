# CS-250-Portfolio
Portfolio of projects for my SNHU Computer Science coursework
Throughout my eight weeks in this course, I learned how to connect user needs with real software features by focusing on what users actually want to achieve. Writing user stories helped me capture those goals clearly and turn them into actionable tasks. When developing programs, I found that Agile methods like sprint planning, stand ups, and retrospectives kept my work organized and flexible. I plan to keep using those same techniques in my future development work to stay adaptable and improve collaboration!
To me, being a good team member in software development means more than writing clean code. Itâ€™s about strrong, effective communication, accountability, and empathy. Working together effectively helps the whole team build better software and continuously improve. This course really helped me understand how process and teamwork combine to create strong, user focused software solutions. I'm proud of what I've accomplished in this short tiem frame.
